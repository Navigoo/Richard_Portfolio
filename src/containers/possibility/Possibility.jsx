    <p>As my nearest describe I am selfmotivated,

      dedicated person with a big portion of

      humor/energy and a natural leader behavior.

      The best of me comes out when I face

      challenges and can use my creative thinking,

      i am not a person who gives up in the first place

      and i have a difficult to understand the

      “impossible” mindset if you haven’t tried

      everything yet to reach your goal or vision.

      On my sparetime i spend as much time as

      possible with my 2 sons and friends, i have an

      passion for cooking and being out on the sea. </p>
